# 3 body timer

This is an electron project to mimic the countdown timer in The Three-Body Problem novel.

## TODO

* Could not find a font that satifies me
* Need to record the current status
* Can add a variation that the time will try to avoid mouse pointer, and when mouse is away, it will go back to center
